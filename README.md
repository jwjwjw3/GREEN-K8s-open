# GREEN-K8s-open

This is Jinghua Wang's Research Project on exploring energy-efficient Kubernetes Schedulers with Deep Learning-based Optimizations.

Project is still an on-going research, implementations and results won't be posted now, but they will be posted here after we finish and submit the GREEN-K8s paper.
